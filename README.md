## Usage

To launch the social network API, ensure you have MongoDB installed and running on your local machine. Then, follow these steps to start the server and sync the Mongoose models to your MongoDB database:

Open your command line interface (CLI).
Navigate to the root directory of the project.
Run the following command to start the server: npm start

To retrieve data from the server, you can use GET requests in Insomnia. This allows you to view formatted JSON data for users and thoughts.

You can create, update, and delete resources using POST, PUT, and DELETE requests in Insomnia as well.
